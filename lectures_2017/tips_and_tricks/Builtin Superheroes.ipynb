    "This video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6VSAsKAj98 is very fun and pretty educational. I learned about some cool corners of Python I was unaware of, and I think the students would like it too. It'd be great to add it as a link for further viewing in your presentation tomorrow. The data analysis starts at 18:00 or so, although it doesn't actually use Pandas. \n",
